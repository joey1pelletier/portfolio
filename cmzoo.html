                <p class="bio-text"><strong class="semi-bold">Summary:</strong> This project is a case study involving the redesign of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo website and it's ticketing experience. I utilized user testing and feedback to create a seamless way for users to purchase zoo tickets. </p>
                <p class="bio-text"><strong class="semi-bold">My role:</strong> This was a solo design and research project. I am responsible for all design decisions implemented in this case study.</p>
                <p class="bio-text"><strong class="semi-bold">Challenge:</strong> I wanted to design a user-friendly experience for this case study. To achieve this, I had to work with the limitations of given info from the actual Cheyenne Mountain Zoo website, as well as the amount of screen space required for a smooth ticket buying experience.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><strong>Testing of current experience:</strong> I conducted 5 usability tests on the current Cheyenne Mountain Zoo website experience.  This allowed me to identify crucial pain points such as a non-intuitive date/time selection and an overabundance of information on ticketing pages. </p>
            <p class="body-text"><strong>Key opportunities:</strong> The pain points allowed me to think about creative ways on how to utilize screen space for a seamless ticketing experience, and how to give users the control of how much information they want to see on a page.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><strong>How might we statement: </strong>How might we provide an non-intrusive ticketing experience to our users, from selection to payment?</p>

            <p class="body-text"><strong>Problem statement: </strong>Zoo-goers need an efficient way to schedule and purchase tickets because they can't wait to connect with amazing animals.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><strong>Task flow: </strong>This flow demonstrates the user experience from start to finish. Certain design situations needed to be made, such as figuring out when users should enter in their ticket amount and select a date/time. This also provides a structure on how pages should be navigated throughout the ticketing experience.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><strong>Low-fidelity wireframes: </strong>These frames provide an initial layout of the pages needed for the ticketing experience. This gave me the idea of combining the ticket and date/time selections onto one side and the cart information on the other. Having the cart on the right side of the page for 'Billing info' gives way for a cohesive experience for users.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><strong>Mid-fidelity wireframes: </strong>I translated my low-fidelity frames into mid-fidelity ones using Figma. One change I made was to have ticket selection before date/time selection. This change accounts for the scenario when tickets may or may not be available on certain dates and times.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><strong>High-fidelity wireframes: </strong>I figured out a font and color scheme for the high-fidelity frames, and added images/content to my pages. I also took instructor feedback, such as a change in navbar size and the usage of different colors for certain components. User tests were performed, and I worked with the pain points of hero image size and additional page content/functionality.</p>
